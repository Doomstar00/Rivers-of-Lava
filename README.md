# Rivers of Lava
Welcome to Io, circa 2300! Humanity has spread through the Solar System and settled many moons and planets, but no one is settling this volcanic hellhole - no one, that is, except for you and your fellow self-replicating robots, here to mine this planet for its rich resources and wipe out anyone else trying to stake their claim. Found factories, research technologies, optimize your code, build drone armies, and bring in the profits for your company!
